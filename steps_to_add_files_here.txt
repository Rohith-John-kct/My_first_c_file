This file contains the steps to add file from IDEs into Github and vice versa using git commands:

1.Install git in the link: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.49.0.windows.1/Git-2.49.0-64-bit.exe
2.Open command prompt window and enter the command :git
3.Set your Github username and email into the Git using the command line:
                git config --global user."#your github username"
                git config --global user."#your github email id"  After this, close the command window
4.Create a folder named 'Git' which later is used to store the Github repository
5.Open this Git folder in code editors like VS code
6.Go to Github and copy the repository(repo) link (also called Origin) by following repo->Code->copy link
7.Now transfer the repository from Github into the Git folder. To do this, use this command in the terminal of the VS Code:git clone repo-link or Origin
  After entering this command, the repo gets cloned or transfered into the Git folder.All the files from the repository will be visible in this local folder
8.The path of the folder in the terminal is C:Git/. To include the repository to the path, try the following:
  In the terminal, enter the command:cd #name_of_repo 
  This command includes the directory to the repository to the terminal's path\
9.IN the folder, all the files of the current repo will be found, but except 1 file which is hidden. To view the hidden file, go to Views->Show->Hidden items
  The hidden .git file will be displayed. This file acts as a bridge between repo and the Git folder
10.Steps in adding a local file from VS Code to the Github repo:
   *Create a text file in the VS Code under the Git folder, named "sample.txt"
   *enter command :git status
    after entering, the terminal says sample.txt is a untracked file. Also, near the file name 'U' symbol is present, which refers to untracted
    Untracked means the sample.txt file is neither found in the local Git folder, nor in the Github repository
   *To add this file in the staging area, enter the command in the VS terminal:git add sample.txt
    After entering this command, the text file gets added in the staging area --> area where the file is getting ready to be pushed in to the Github repository
    This makes the file tracked. To check whether it is tracked, again use the command :git status.
    Now, the file is tracked. Also, the 'U' symbol gets changed to 'A' meaning added
   *To add this sample.txt file into the Git folder from the staging area, use this command:git commit -m "sample.txt file added"
   *Now, to add this file in the main branch of Github page (in the browser), use the command :git push origin main
    For new users, the file is not directly transferred into the Github page, instead, the authencation between VS Code and the Github pops up. 
    After completing the authencation process, the sample.txt file gets transferred into the Github page.
